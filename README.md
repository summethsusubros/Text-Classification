# Text-Classification
Text classification on IMDb dataset

## Text-Classification

In simple words, Text-Classification is categorisation of text under different pre-labeled classes according to its nature.
In this project, we will build text classifier using different models to classify IMDb reviews as positive and negative review.

## Dataset
Here we use the famous IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews. You can either clone this repo or download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

## Resources required
-Numpy

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-sklearn

-re

-Tensorflow keras

-ktrain

## How do we do this?
We use the power of count vectors and Tfidf vectors to get features from the text data and using these features we predict the classes using different classification algorithms.
